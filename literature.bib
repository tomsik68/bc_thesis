abstract="Many static analyzers exploit sparseness techniques to reduce the amount of information being propagated and stored during analysis. Although several variations are described in the literature, no existing technique is suitable for analyzing JavaScript code. In this paper, we point out the need for a sparse analysis framework that supports pointers and reachability.We present such a framework, which uses static single assignment form for heap addresses and computes def-use information on-the-fly.We also show that essential information about dominating definitions can be maintained efficiently using quadtrees. The framework is presented as a systematic modification of a traditional dataflow analysis algorithm.",
