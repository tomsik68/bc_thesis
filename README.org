* Assignment
The aim of this thesis is to speed of reaching definitions analysis in
[[https://staticafi.github.io/symbiotic][Symbiotic]] tool. Student will study modern techniques of computing
reaching definitions and briefly describe them. One of the techniques
will be discussed in depth and implemented into Symbiotic. 

The thesis shall contain experimental comparison of the old and new
implementation of reaching definitions analysis using non-trivial set
of benchmarks, for example [[https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks][SV-COMP benchmarks set]].

* How to preview
The most convenient way is to open thesis.org directly on Github. Github is
able to preview it with some small exceptions.


** How to compile
I will use Emacs org-mode together with LaTeX to write this thesis.

1. Produce =thesis.tex= by loading =thesis.org= in emacs hitting
=C-c C-e l l=

2. use =latexmk -pdf thesis.tex=.

There is a =pvc= script that re-builds the pdf each time =thesis.tex= is updated.
